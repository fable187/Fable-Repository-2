 Fixed width Formatter



Created By:  Padraic Gilbert




Thanks for your interest in my formatter.  I created this script to deal with large fixed width text files.  Large in this context is something +200K rows.  
It uses pandas to format the text file based on the layout file its provided.   


This requires to inputs:

1)  A Layout File.  This just needs to be a two columned file, in first column you need the column names for your fixed width file.  The second column should have the widths for Each Column
in your File.  

2) A save folder and name you want to save your csv as.
